            <div class=post-text>
                <p>In this days I faced with an issue on a EC2 with Amazon Linux related to a CA Root.<br />
Was impossible execute <code>docker pull</code> from our private registry, the error appear was: <code>x509: certificate signed by unknown authority</code>.</p>
<p>The Certficate Authority used by registry was recently changed and wasn't trusted by os.<br />
Solution has been to add the CA Root inside <code>/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/</code> then run <code>update-ca-trust</code> and all worked after Docker restarting.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Choose carefully your next CA.</p>
