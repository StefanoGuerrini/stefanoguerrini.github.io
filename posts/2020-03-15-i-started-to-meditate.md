I have always wanted to meditate.  
I was fascinate about it some years ago after had read about it in some books but I never started to praticate.  
When I went to Japan I have attended to a lesson given by a buddhist monk so I promised myself to start to praticate but I forgot it until some weeks ago after I have watched the umpteenth video that talk about meditation and how much is important to personal growth I decided (finally) to start to praticate it.  
I have started using _'Calm'_ that is an app that contains a lot of courses some of them are for beginners and can help you to learn how meditate.  
After I had tried the trial of the premium version of _'Calm'_ I stopped using it and I started to using _'Insight Timer'_ that contains many guided meditations for free and have very useful filters.  
I'm also reading _'A million thoughts'_ in parallel to the learning of the meditation.  
At the moment I like it and I'm interested to go in deep of this practice so I will keep to discover it in his varius forms.
