My name is Stefano Guerrini, I was born in Messina 24 years ago. 
I moved to Milan a few years ago.

I am an backend developer who working with varius technologies, Java in particular is my first programming language. 
I love to learn about new technologies, at moment I'm studing about reactive systems.
I want to improve always myself and have often new objectives.
I consider myself a person dynamic and smart, always funny, and when is necessary a serious and finicking developer. :)
